## Overview

**Project Title**: Webcomic Library

**Project Description**: A webcomic library created through an SQL Relational Database

**Project Goals**: Be able to save information on comics that you've read, and be able to access, edit, and remove that information

Instructions for using the software:

1. Enter what you want to do (view, add, edit, delete, leave)
2. Enter the information for sorting/filtering when viewing, other comic info for other options
3. Repeat until satisfied

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* VSCode

## Useful Websites to Learn More

* [Python SQLite3](https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/sqlite3.html)
* [Tutorials Point SQLite - Python](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_python.htm)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add error handling for trying to interact with comic titles that don't exist
* [ ] Let users sort and filter by multiple options at once
* [ ] Let users skip the sorting/filtering phase of viewing if desired
